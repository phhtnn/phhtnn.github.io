# Notes on Web Development

The project was created as part of my [non-degree studies in web development](https://ict-alan-osaajaksi.pages.labranet.jamk.fi/03.-Moderni-ohjelmistokehitys/sisalto/). The aim was to serve three purposes as i) notes to myself on things I have learned, ii) a learning diary for my studies and iii) a portfolio of my skills in web development.
