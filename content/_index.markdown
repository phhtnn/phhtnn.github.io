# Notes on Web Development

I started creating these pages as part of my [non-degree studies in web development](https://ict-alan-osaajaksi.pages.labranet.jamk.fi/03.-Moderni-ohjelmistokehitys/sisalto/) with the [MERN stack](https://www.mongodb.com/mern-stack). They aimed to serve three purposes as i) notes to myself on things I have learned, ii) a learning diary for my studies and iii) a portfolio of my skills in web development. My plan was to make a collection of short notes with enough context to help me recall the details and essentials in the future.

In our studies, we practiced our software development skills also in a project. Our team had an imaginary startup company with a make-believe contract to deliver a discussion forum. Our solution was based on ["the mother of all demo apps"](https://realworld-docs.netlify.app/) and we had dailies, retros, etc during our project. Some of our work might still be available at the ["company's" site](https://ff2020s-team3.pages.labranet.jamk.fi/site/) or in the [project's documentation](https://ff2020s-team3.pages.labranet.jamk.fi/core/).
