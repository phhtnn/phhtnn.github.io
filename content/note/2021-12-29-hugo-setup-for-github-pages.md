Just to note that [Hugo's guide](https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-github/) on how to host the site on GitHub Pages is a great help. The work on building and deploying is mostly done by the GitHub Actions for [GitHub Pages](https://github.com/peaceiris/actions-gh-pages) and [Hugo](https://github.com/peaceiris/actions-hugo). There is also advice on the [first deployment](https://github.com/peaceiris/actions-gh-pages#%EF%B8%8F-first-deployment-with-github_token). Also, I'd like to note that using a public repository for the site meant that I had to pay attention to the [license](https://github.com/phhtnn/phhtnn.github.io/blob/main/LICENSE.md).
