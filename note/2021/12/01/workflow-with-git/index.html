It seems to me that there are things one can learn using Git on a project of one&rsquo;s own. And then there are workflows that one develops while collaborating with others. These four groups of Git users described in the <a href=https://git-scm.com/docs/giteveryday#_description>Git documentation</a> make a lot sense now. I&rsquo;m hope that I moved a bit closer to the level of &ldquo;Individual Developer (Participant)&rdquo; during this autumn. To further develop my Git skills, the online version of <a href=https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2>Pro Git</a> book seems to be a great resource. It gives more details than the various Getting Started guides usually do, but it&rsquo;s not as advanced as the <a href=https://git-scm.com/docs>Git Reference</a>.</p><p>One thing I realized during the project was that the commit history matters. This <a href=https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2018/06/07/keeping-git-commit-history-clean/>GitLab blog post</a> gives advice on managing the commit history starting with <code>git commit --amend</code> that adds to the latest commit. Other interesting thing that I learned is related to <code>git merge</code>. It is <em>not</em> like saving a file with the same name, where the new file overwrites the old one. According to this <a href=https://stackoverflow.com/a/14962580>Stack Overflow answer</a>, <code>git merge</code> (in the recursive mode) checks for changes in both of the commits to be merged <em>relative to their common earlier commit</em> and those changes are applied to the new commit. The Pro Git book has more on this with a <a href=https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Basic-Branching-and-Merging>basic</a> and an <a href=https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Advanced-Merging#_advanced_merging>advanced</a> entry.</p><p>Adopting <code>git stash</code> to my workflow is more in the work-in-progress category for me. Like Oliver Steele points out in his <a href=https://blog.osteele.com/2008/05/my-git-workflow/>blog post</a>, one can use <code>git stash</code> instead of making copies of the files to some <em>stash</em> folder during the development process. In the post, there are also some rather illustrative pictures on different Git concepts. And one should not forget that the <a href=https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Stashing-and-Cleaning>Git book</a> has some great stuff in it, too.</p></main><footer><hr>Content Â© 2021 Petri Huhtanen, all rights reserved | Built with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>, <a href=https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/hugo-xmin/>XMin</a>, <a href=https://pages.github.com/>GitHub Pages</a></footer></body></html>
