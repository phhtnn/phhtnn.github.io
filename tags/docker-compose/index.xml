The basics of named volumes and bind mounts are covered in the Get started guide. The more detailed information on managing data is also very helpful in choosing, which kind of mount to use in different use cases. Also, links to more detailed information on volumes, bind mounts and tmpfs mounts is provided.</description></item></channel></rss>
