It seems to me that there are things one can learn using Git on a project of one&amp;rsquo;s own. And then there are workflows that one develops while collaborating with others. These four groups of Git users described in the Git documentation make a lot sense now. I&amp;rsquo;m hope that I moved a bit closer to the level of &amp;ldquo;Individual Developer (Participant)&amp;rdquo; during this autumn.</description></item></channel></rss>
